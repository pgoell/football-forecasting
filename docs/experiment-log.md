## 2026-09-28: Phase 2 engine, first three models

Data seen: warm-up, development and validation seasons (2000/01 to 2022/23). The holdout is never loaded.

Models:

- `naive-v1`: league base rates of H, D and A from all earlier seasons.
- `market-consensus-v1`: median of devigged probabilities across reliable, non-aggregate bookmakers, from the odds of the horizon's own moment. At `close` before 2019/20 only Pinnacle has closing odds (2012/13 onward), so the consensus there is Pinnacle alone.
- `elo-v1`: K 20, home advantage 60, ratings carried across seasons; mapped to H/D/A by an ordered logit on the rating difference, refit on all earlier results at each new season. K and home advantage were fixed by hand, not tuned.

Promoted-team prior: 1400, from `research/elo-promoted-prior/prior.py`, which uses the warm-up seasons only: the mean end-of-season rating of the 24 teams relegated there came out at 1402.

Each table scores the matches all three models predicted. `close` in development covers 2012/13 to 2018/19 only (no closing odds before).

| Period | Horizon | n | Naive | Elo | Market |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| development | pre | 9,604 | 1.0636 | 0.9854 | 0.9738 |
| development | close | 4,801 | 1.0639 | 0.9778 | 0.9619 |
| validation | pre | 2,744 | 1.0714 | 0.9933 | 0.9769 |
| validation | close | 2,744 | 1.0714 | 0.9933 | 0.9745 |

Log loss. The market beats Elo at `pre` in all 18 seasons and at `close` in all 11. Leaving out `pre_timing_uncertain` matches moves no log loss by more than 0.002.

Reading: the engine works and shows no sign of leakage (Elo would beat the market if it saw results early). Phase 2 exit criterion met.
